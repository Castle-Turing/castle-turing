# The private layer

*What you must write, file by file, to make Castle Turing yours. This
repo — the public one — is the castle: mechanism only. Your private repo
is the resident. This document is the complete interface between them; if
you find yourself needing something not listed here, that is a bug in the
framework's design, not in your configuration.*

## Shape

One private git repository (do not fork this one — Principle 01:
customization is the contents of the private layer, not a fork of the
code). Minimum contents:

```
flake.nix       Assembles your machine from this repo's exported modules.
flake.lock      Pins the exact rev of the public repo — an audit artifact.
resident.nix    Who you are: the castle.admin values.
README.md       Optional but recommended: what lives here and what must not.
```

## `flake.nix`

Take this repo as an input and instantiate a `nixosConfiguration` from
its exported modules:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    castle-turing.url = "github:whharris/castle-turing";
    nixpkgs.follows = "castle-turing/nixpkgs";
  };

  outputs =
    { nixpkgs, castle-turing, ... }:
    {
      nixosConfigurations.<yourhost> = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
        system = "x86_64-linux";
        modules = [
          castle-turing.nixosModules.base
          castle-turing.nixosModules.host-xps9370 # or your own host module
          ./resident.nix
        ];
      };
    };
}
```

The exported modules:

- `nixosModules.base` — the substrate every host shares: flakes enabled,
  SSH hardened, the admin user declared from `castle.admin.*` options.
  It asserts that you supplied an identity; an empty resident does not
  build.
- `nixosModules.host-xps9370` — the reference machine (Dell XPS 13 9370),
  with its nixos-hardware and disko modules already bound. On other
  hardware, write your own host module in your private repo (or better,
  PR it here — hosts are public, machine facts identify no one) following
  `hosts/xps9370/`'s shape.

`nixpkgs.follows = "castle-turing/nixpkgs"` keeps your system on exactly
the package set the framework is tested against. Omit it only if you know
why.

## `resident.nix`

The values this repo may never contain:

```nix
{ ... }:
{
  castle.admin = {
    username = "<your-login>";
    sshKeys = [ "<your-openssh-public-key>" ];
  };
}
```

- `castle.admin.username` — login name of the human administrator.
- `castle.admin.sshKeys` — OpenSSH public key strings granted admin
  access (both to your user and to root, for remote rebuilds). Public
  keys are not secrets, but they identify a person — that is why they
  live here.

## `flake.lock`

Commit it. The pin of `castle-turing` records precisely which public
mechanism your private configuration was built against; updating it is
the deliberate act of adopting new framework behavior, and the diff of
the pin is part of your audit trail.

## Slots that exist but are still empty

These are part of the interface by design; the framework will consume
them from the private layer as the corresponding features land. Reserve
the space, do not invent formats yet:

- **Stated priorities** — the document the agent triages against (see
  `docs/vision.md`). Format not yet specified.
- **Authority taxonomy** — which decision categories are silent,
  made-then-reported, or queued for approval. Format not yet specified.
- **Secrets** — encrypted via sops-nix, once that tooling enters the
  public flake. Until then: **no plaintext credentials anywhere**, the
  private repo included. A private repo is access control, not
  encryption.
- **The agent's model of you** — accumulated context and the decision
  journal. Shape arrives with the agent tooling.

## Test

Hand this document to someone who has never seen your private repo. If
they cannot write their own from scratch this weekend, file the gap as a
bug here.
